# Dhrystone Benchmark Program

This demo executes the Dhrystone 2.1 benchmark program on the eTPU and provides the Dhrystone score and DMIPS result.

The demo requires tools from ASH WARE, see https://www.ashware.com/.  It currently points at DevTool 2.75C and ETEC 3.01C, but older versions can be used.

To run this demo, open Proj.ETpuIdeProj in DevTool, then in the `Run` menu select `Reset and Go`.

After running the benchmark, a dialog will open with the Dhrystone calculation result.
